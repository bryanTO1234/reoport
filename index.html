            Investigation and plan
          </h2>
          <p>
            for my leaving cert coursework 2022 computer science project I had to investigate and research a smart home system that will meet the requirments for ordinary level. I used the primary source www.google.com to google diferent types smart home devices.I saw ideas like metion sensors that turn on lights, Solar panels, plant watering system, Password and door etc.I then had to plan out what equipment i will use, How much the equipment will cost, how i will start. I then planned out how I will make my website. I had to decide which software developing approach I will take agile or waterfall.     Agile vs. waterfall
One of the differences between agile software development methods and waterfall is the approach to quality and testing. In the waterfall model, work moves through software development lifecycle (SDLC) phases—with one phase being completed before another can start—hence the testing phase is separate and follows a build phase. In agile software development, however, testing is completed in the same iteration as programming. Another way of looking at it is “Agile: make it up as you go along. Waterfall: make it up before you start, live with the consequences”. [41]

Because testing is done in every iteration—which develops a small piece of the software—users can frequently use those new pieces of software and validate the value. After the users know the real value of the updated piece of software, they can make better decisions about the software's future. Having a value retrospective and software re-planning session in each iteration—Scrum typically has iterations of just two weeks—helps the team continuously adapt its plans so as to maximize the value it delivers. This follows a pattern similar to the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle, as the work is planned, done, checked (in the review and retrospective), and any changes agreed are acted upon.

This iterative approach supports a product rather than a project mindset. This provides greater flexibility throughout the development process; whereas on projects the requirements are defined and locked down from the very beginning, making it difficult to change them later. Iterative product development allows the software to evolve in response to changes in business environment or market requirements.

Code vs. documentation
In a letter to IEEE Computer, Steven Rakitin expressed cynicism about agile software development, calling it "yet another attempt to undermine the discipline of software engineering" and translating "working software over comprehensive documentation" as "we want to spend all our time coding. Remember, real programmers don't write documentation."[42]

This is disputed by proponents of agile software development, who state that developers should write documentation if that is the best way to achieve the relevant goals, but that there are often better ways to achieve those goals than writing static documentation.[43] Scott Ambler states that documentation should be "just barely good enough" (JBGE),[44] that too much or comprehensive documentation would usually cause waste, and developers rarely trust detailed documentation because it's usually out of sync with code,[43] while too little documentation may also cause problems for maintenance, communication, learning and knowledge sharing. Alistair Cockburn wrote of the Crystal Clear method:

Crystal considers development a series of co-operative games, and intends that the documentation is enough to help the next win at the next game. The work products for Crystal include use cases, risk list, iteration plan, core domain models, and design notes to inform on choices...however there are no templates for these documents and descriptions are necessarily vague, but the objective is clear, just enough documentation for the next game. I always tend to characterize this to my team as: what would you want to know if you joined the team tomorrow.

            For my website I made a navbar with the titles Home,Info,contacts and login. I decided to do a login and password that takes you to a profile page to get extra marks for my project. Then I started to do the microbit coding part of my computer science course work.My idea is that i have one micro bit in my hand and the other microbit at the door and when the microbit in my hand is near the second microbit at the door at a ceterian distance the second microbit will activate a servo to open the door.

            First time I Tested it it didnt work on my old project. my old project was a password and door where the user sets a password for the door to open but the only problem is that the servo could never work so the I changed it the project where you move closer the door opens. I think its better because its easier and its easier for the user its user friendly because all you need to do is to walk closer to the door.The website glitch to make the the website for my leaving cert computer science course work 2022.I used difrennt types of coding laugueges like html, java script and css with help with my coding knowledge.Glitch is a software company specializing in project management tools. Its products include project management and content management, and code review tools. The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.  Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

          <p>
          If I was to redo my project I would have did something better but my class was in a rush since our teacher missed 3 weeks off school and I didnt have enought time to make my project better then this. The project I would have done solar panels when one microbit is on the roof and when it gets to hot it sends a signal to the second microbit which will turn on all the lights.
