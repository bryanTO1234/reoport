          <h2>
            Investigation and plan
          </h2>
          <p>
            for my leaving cert coursework 2022 computer science project I had to investigate and research a smart home system that will meet the requirments for ordinary level. I used the primary source www.google.com to google diferent types smart home devices.I saw ideas like metion sensors that turn on lights, Solar panels, plant watering system, Password and door etc.I then had to plan out what equipment i will use, How much the equipment will cost, how i will start. I then planned out how I will make my website.      
          </p>
          
          <h2>
            Design
          </h2>
          <p>
            For my website I made a navbar with the titles Home,Info,contacts and login. I decided to do a login and password that takes you to a profile page to get extra marks for my project. Then I started to do the microbit coding part of my computer science course work.My idea is that i have one micro bit in my hand and the other microbit at the door and when the microbit in my hand is near the second microbit at the door at a ceterian distance the second microbit will activate a servo to open the door.
          </p>
          
          <h2>
            Implementation and Testing
          </h2>
          <p>
            First time I Tested it it didnt work on my old project. my old project was a password and door where the user sets a password for the door to open but the only problem is that the servo could never work so the I changed it the project where you move closer the door opens. I think its better because its easier and its easier for the user its user friendly because all you need to do is to walk closer to the door.
          </p>
          
          <h2>
            Evaluation
          </h2>
          <p>
          If I was to redo my project I would have did something better but my class was in a rush since our teacher missed 3 weeks off school and I didnt have enought time to make my project better then this. The project I would have done solar panels when one microbit is on the roof and when it gets to hot it sends a signal to the second microbit which will turn on all the lights.
